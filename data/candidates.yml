    My name is William D. Fox, and I'm a full-time Redhill Forest resident and retired professional 
    running for the Board of Managers. I'm committed to improving transparency, rebuilding trust, and 
    involving members in decisions that shape our community. With the time and dedication to serve, I 
    support responsible spending, fair and consistent policies, and alignment with our governing 
    documents. I want to enhance our common areas, fire mitigation, and walkability, while attracting 
    quality builders to boost property values and RHF's reputation. I believe in open communication, 
    social connection, and creating a welcoming, engaged community where every voice is heard.

    design and marketing business owner, I've worked with companies of all sizes and bring valuable 
    management and building experience to the table. I'm a team player who thrives on collaboration and 
    challenges. As a candidate, I'm committed to being open-minded, listening to all perspectives, and 
    helping guide thoughtful decisions that serve the best interests of our community.

    Hi, I'm Suzette Watkins, and I'm running for the Redhill HOA Board because I believe it's 
    time your voice was truly heard. I'm a proven visionary, a direct communicator, a critical 
    thinker, and someone who genuinely values great customer service. I'm running to bring 
    transparency back to our HOA, limit board and committee overreach, and make sure every member has a 
    say in what happens in our community. I'll push for road and common area improvements, and I'm 
    committed to ending secrecy in our governing processes. This is our community, and I'll work 
    hard to ensure it reflects all of us.
